        <p><strong>Last updated on:</strong> 09-02-2025 20:18:05</p>

        <p><strong>JAFARKHAN Audio-Loom </strong> believes in helping its customers as far as possible and has therefore adopted a liberal cancellation policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order. However, cancellation may not be possible if the order has already been processed by vendors/merchants.</li>
            <li>Cancellations are not accepted for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc. However, refund/replacement can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of the delivered product is poor.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Damaged or Defective Products</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you receive a damaged or defective item, please report it to our Customer Service team immediately.</li>
            <li>The issue must be reported on the same day of receiving the product. The request will be entertained after the merchant verifies the issue.</li>
            <li>If the product received does not match the description or your expectations, you must contact our customer service within the same day of receiving the product.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Manufacturer Warranty</h2>
        <p>For products that come with a manufacturer's warranty, please contact the manufacturer for any issues.</p>

        <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If a refund is approved by <strong>JAFARKHAN Audio-Loom</strong>, it will be processed within <strong>1-2 days</strong> to the end customer.</li>
        </ul>
